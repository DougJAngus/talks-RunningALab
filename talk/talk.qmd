## Where my perspective comes from

![](./images/timeline.png){.absolute top="10%" left="0%" height="80%"}


## Disclaimers

- I have all of the biases inherent in being a lucky survivor
- I have only worked at large, well funded US R1 institutions with generous startup packages

There are almost certainly people who violate each of the rules I will outline and still succeed in academia.


## What's different about being PI vs. being a trainee? 
::: {.incremental}
- You are expected to be a leader and a manager
    - and less of a "doer"
- The total weight of responsibilty as well as the range of responsibilities will likely increase
:::

## What's not different:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- You are still you
- You will still need mentoring
- You constantly have to learn new things and adapt to changing realities

'If you find yourself concentrating on the technology rather
than the sociology, you're like the vaudeville character who loses
his keys on a dark street and looks for them on the adjacent street
because, as he explains, "The light is better there."'(DeMarco & Lister, Peopleware, 2nd ed.)

## What's different about being a PI versus working in industry?

- Comments from former trainees now working in industry:
    - Leadership in academia is more all encompassing: A PI takes on many functions! You are the recruiter, the spokesperson, the fundraiser, the research director, etc. Leadership in industry will be multifaceted, but you will have more of a "lane"
    - In tech, "leadership" and "people management" are not necessarily the same thing. They often move together, but don't need to. In academia these often are one-in-the-same.
    - In industry, I've been given executive coaches and completed (literally) years of leadership training.  I don't think there's a real analogue to what I've experienced for PIs.
-->


## The training mismatch for academic PIs 

There are many aspects of the PI's job that we are never trained for!

## How not to manage anxiety

- Avoid the anxiety-provoking situation
- Assume it will just go away on its own


## Establishing a productivity workflow

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Your work responsibilities will be much greater as a PI than as a trainee.
- The only way to thrive as a PI is to have a good system in place to manage them.
- This will require a level of organizational discipline that is beyond what most of you ever needed as a trainee.

## Risk management 

::: {.notes}
Identify possible risks to your productivity and do whatever you can to mitigate them

- Keep all important files backed up to the cloud
- If feasible, keep a hot spare laptop that remains synced to your cloud drive
- Make PDFs of any talks and put them in a place where you can easily access them from someone else's computer if yours dies/gets lost or stolen

## Building a lab culture {data-background-image="images/desola-lanre-ologun-IgUR1iX0mqM-unsplash.jpg" data-background-size="120%" data-background-opacity=".15"}

- "How do you do things around here, and why?"
- You are responsible for establishing the culture of the lab
- "The culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior the leader is willing to tolerate." (Grunert & Whitaker)

## Annual climate survey

![](./images/labsurvey_result.png){.absolute top="10%" left="45%" height="80%"}

## IRB compliance {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

- A culture of strict compliance is essential
  - Never cover up a deviation; report it to the IRB immediately.
- Organized record-keeping for all human subjects is essential


## Hiring people: Follow the science

- There is an extensive literature showing that prediction of human behavior based on in-person interviews (known as "clinical prediction") performs systematically worse than prediction based on data (known as "actuarial prediction")

>  “There is no controversy in social science which shows such a large body of qualitatively diverse studies coming out so uniformly in the same direction as this one." (Meehl, 1986)

"Perhaps the greatest technological achievement in industrial and organizational (I–O) psychology over the past 100 years is the development of decision aids (e.g., paper-and-pencil tests, structured interviews,
mechanical combination of predictors) that substantially reduce error in the prediction of employee performance. Arguably, the greatest failure of I–O psychology has been the inability to convince employers to use them. " (Highhouse, 2008)

<!--
##  Judgmental biases that affect unstructured interviews {style="font-size: 1.25em;"}

- Sensemaking
    - An interviewer will make sense of nearly anything that the interviewee says
- Dilution
    - Irrelevant information can weaken the impact of predictive information
- Dawes et al, 2013
    - Interviewers were equally confident when the interviewee gave accurate vs. random interview responses
    - "Although participants judged the interview to be somewhat informative, GPA predictions were actually less accurate with interviews (r = .31) than without them (r = .61)."

## Debiasing interviews 

- Structured interviews outperform unstructured interviews
    - "Interviews with higher degrees of structure show higher levels of validity, rater reliability, rater agreement, and less adverse impact." (US Office of Personnel Management)
- Joint vs separate evaluation
    - "Evaluators are more likely to base their decisions on individual performance in joint than in separate evaluation and on group stereotypes in separate than in joint evaluation"(Bohnet et al., 2016)

## The planning fallacy  {data-background-image="images/MindView-Gantt_Chart.png" data-background-size="120%" data-background-opacity=".10"}

- People tend "to underestimate the time required to complete a project, even when they have considerable experience of past failures to live up to planned schedules." (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
    - We form an initial optimistic estimate and fail to incorporate knowledge about past problems
    - Memory for the duration of past events is systematically underestimated (Roy et al., 2005)

<!-- 
## Even professionals succumb to the planning fallacy

- Standish Group report on IT project success

## Managing finances  {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

- Managing money is one of the most stressful aspects of being a PI
  - Your career and your employee's paychecks lie in the balance
- Overspending is an obvious problem
  - But underspending on grants can be almost as bad
- PI's rarely have the financial management resources that are available in business
    - It can be very difficult to get actionable insight into one's financial situation

## Grant budgeting {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

- *Never* propose to do more than the budget can actually pay for
- Prepare to receive less than you budgeted
  - It has been common in recent years for NIH Institutes to fund 10% less than the proposed budget

## Budget categories {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

- NIH Budget Categories:
  - Personnel
  - Equipment (over $5000)
  - Travel
  - Other direct costs (e.g. supplies and materials, MRI scanning, computing services)
- Moving funds between categories or to a new category usually requires agency permission
  - NIH allows funds to be moved between categories up to a limit of 25%

## Facilities and Administrative costs

- AKA "indrect costs" or "overhead"
- Meant to pay for the general resources of the university that allow research to work
- Indirects are generally split between:
    - the University
    - the College
    - the Department
    - sometimes the PI ("Indirect Cost Recovery")
      - Usually not at highly-funded institutions


## Faculty salary {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

- Most "hard-money" faculty are paid for 9 months by the university
- They can earn an additional 3 months ("summer salary") from grants or other funds (e.g. startup funds)
- In some institutions, one can "buy out" teaching time with grant funds
- In some cases, if one pays for effort during the academic year, the funds can be recovered as "salary savings"


## Conclusions  {style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

- Your success as a PI will largely be determined by a combination of non-intellectual factors and luck
- The primary non-intellectual factors under your control are managing yourself and others
- With effort and discipline, any of you can succeed and thrive as a PI

## Comments from twitter

Strategic planning, setting an org chart, we setting expectations early, publication/authorship process or policy. Reminding them everything will take longer than it should.



shifting mentality from “doer” to “one who oversees” work
- Ditto! I've found that keeping small pet projects, in no one's critical path, mostly scratches the doer itch. That said, small pets can grow into dangerous beasts...


Transitions from the one doing the work to the one managing students doing the work. For new PIs without PhD students this is incredibly hard. Oh, and the first few generations of RAs you hire are so important to establish lab culture, to develop your behavioral or MRI protocols, data scoring protocols, etc.


How to run a meeting, what notes to have/take, file naming or other workflow best practices


How to sustainably prioritize your own development while the day to day of training, supervising, writing, and collaborating always seem to require more urgent attention

Planning the division of labor - how hands on to be when breaking a larger project into tasks for others, how you do that with folks of varying experience levels, etc.

IMO bringing in a good RA/lab manager, recruiting a good student, and data collection.

Personnel management and navigating bureaucracy/workplace politics!

I'm not a junior faculty, but still... I wish I had learned to say "no" to things that don't yield value or that overload me.  As a matter of fact, it is a skill I still don't have

How to spend your startup, how to manage and mentor people/employees and navigating difficult conversations, finding the right balance between doing and delegating, and how to not forget about your family and friends (I literally had to start an Asana with my husband today)


# Hard vs. Soft money positions
- most college faculty get 9 months of salary paid ("hard money")
	- can earn up to 3 months of "summer salary"
- most medical school faculty must raise most or all of their salary from grants ("soft money")


## academia vs industry

from Ian:

 In general, I agree that being a PI has similar demands as a leader/manager in tech. To such an extent that I wish PIs had more support and training in management skills! From the outside, it seems like PIs could benefit from management insights in the same way that scientists benefit from better coding practices.

To your main question - potential differences between academia and industry:

    Communicating context is more important in industry: A large (primary?) role of manager/leader in industry is providing context to the direct report. Done well, this enables them to work fully and independently while still aligned with goals larger than themself. On the face, this isn't that different between academia and industry. In academia, one can think of this context as "what the field cares about", or "what are important scientific problems", and a PI is responsible for sharing this context. However, the context changes more slowly in science, and it's more possible for the trainee to develop their own perspective on scientific context via their own explorations (through literature review, conferences, etc) than in industry. In industry, it is critical for the manager to provide this context.
    Coordinating with other leaders is more important in industry: In industry, your role as leader likely means that you are responsible for coordinating with other leaders to a far greater extent than in academia. Labs are relatively independent units. That's much less the case in industry, even for relatively modularized organizations. This relates to the context point above - generally a leader is responsible for coordinating with others, synthesizing the higher level context, and communicating the important bits to enable others.
    Leadership != management: In tech, "leadership" and "people management" are not necessarily the same thing. They often move together, but don't need to. In academia, like most industries, these often are one-in-the-same. But even there they don't need to be. Leadership can be expressed by IC/trainees.
    Leadership in academia is more all encompassing: A PI takes on many functions! You are the recruiter, the spokesperson, the fundraiser, the research director, etc. Leadership in industry will be multifaceted, but you will have more of a "lane"


The main thing I'd hammer home is the difference between "IC" and "management". As a PI, you are a manager. Even if you do your own work, stay in the weeds, etc, your greatest effect will be from enabling others to do more. That's a big difference! So not only are you responsible for other people's careers, but the highest leverage use of time is also likely via those other people. 




## Acknowledgments

- I have spent my faculty career at R1 institutions in the US
  - Harvard Medical School, UCLA, Univ of Texas, and Stanford
  - Not all elite, but all well-regarded and relatively well funded
- I've been lucky to be at the right place at the right time (i.e. at the birth of fMRI)
- I have been able to move relatively easily which has open up opportunities



## The responsibilities of a junior PI
- Continue developing new scientific ideas and shepherding them to completion
- Develop an international research presence (publish papers, give talks, social media presence)
- Mentor and support your trainees
- Obtain funding to support your research
- Be an effective teacher
- Be a good community member (local, national, and international)

## What are the features of a good manager?

Being a good manager involves a combination of skills, traits, and behaviors that enable you to lead your team effectively and achieve the organization's goals. Here are some essential elements of being a good manager:

    Clear Communication: A good manager should be able to communicate effectively with their team members. This includes providing clear instructions, active listening, and constructive feedback.

    Delegation: A good manager knows how to delegate tasks to team members according to their strengths and weaknesses. This allows the manager to focus on more strategic tasks and helps team members grow professionally.

    Decision-making: A good manager should be able to make informed decisions in a timely manner. This involves analyzing data, weighing the pros and cons of different options, and considering the impact of decisions on the team and organization.

    Motivation: A good manager should be able to motivate and inspire their team members to perform at their best. This involves recognizing and rewarding good performance, providing constructive feedback, and creating a positive work environment.

    Accountability: A good manager should hold themselves and their team members accountable for their actions and results. This involves setting clear expectations, monitoring progress, and addressing performance issues.

    Adaptability: A good manager should be able to adapt to changing circumstances and navigate challenges. This involves being flexible, creative, and willing to try new approaches.

Overall, being a good manager involves having a deep understanding of your team's needs, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as the ability to create a positive and productive work environment.

> - Adaptability

- As with leadership, these are all things that any of us can learn to do, but they require diligent effort and discipline.


## Record keeping

- Get in the habit of taking notes whenever you meet with a trainee or employee
  - There will be a lot happening and you will forget things if you don't write them down
- Especially important in any cases where there might be problems that you need to document later
  - Such as personnel issues

## Leadership vs management

- A PI must be both a leader and a manager
    - A leader motivates people and inspires them with a sense of agency around a set of shared goals
    - A manager provides people with the resources they need to do their work and helps keep the work on track
